## About
"Things end but memories last forever"
LifeChain is a revolutionary platform, that collects photos from the patients, and their caretakers, to upload their memories in the form of photos, audio, text and related tags. Our algorithm uses generative AI to convert these discrete elements into a proper collaborated memory and allow the patient to relive their experiences at any place, any time! It also has features that can enable the user to explore and experience the experiences of people who consent to share their memories in the same format. Another functionality that allows users to sharpen their memory is the feature of flashcards and quizzes that helps them recollect and retain memory for a longer period of tim. All the data collected is stored in blockchain that makes it technically impossible for unauthorized people to access them.
